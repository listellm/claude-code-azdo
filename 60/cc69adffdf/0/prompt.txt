# gh-ship: Branch → Commit → PR → CI → Merge → CI

> **GitHub repos only.** Before doing anything, confirm the repo has a GitHub remote (`git remote -v`).
> If the remote is Azure DevOps or anything other than `github.com`, stop and tell the user this command does not apply — use the ADO MCP tools instead.

Ship the current working changes end-to-end on GitHub. Run each phase in order, stopping if anything fails.

## Phase 1: Branch

Check current branch with `git branch --show-current`.

- If on `main` or `master`: create a feature branch. Derive the name from the staged changes or `` if provided. Use kebab-case, prefixed with `fix/` or `feat/` per commit convention. Ask if unclear.
- If already on a feature branch: continue.

## Phase 2: Commit

Run `git status` and `git diff --cached` to understand what is staged.

- If nothing is staged: run `git diff --stat` to show unstaged changes, then ask which files to stage.
- Stage and commit following the project commit convention (semantic: `fix:`, `feat:`, `breaking:`; subject ≤50 chars; bullet body with emojis). Do not skip pre-commit hooks (`--no-verify` is forbidden unless the user explicitly requests it).
- If pre-commit hooks modify files, re-stage and commit again.

## Phase 3: Push & PR

Push the branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`.

Create the PR using `gh pr create`. Follow the project PR format:
- Short title (≤70 chars)
- Body with `## Summary` bullets and no test plan section
- Add `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code)` footer

Show the PR URL.

## Phase 4: CI Check (post-PR)

Wait for CI to complete: `gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 5` then watch the most recent run with `gh run watch <run-id>`.

- If CI passes: proceed to Phase 5.
- If CI fails: show the failed job logs (`gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`), diagnose, fix, commit, push. Re-run Phase 4.

## Phase 5: Merge

Once CI is green: `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` (use squash unless the user specifies otherwise).

Confirm the merge completed and the branch was deleted.

## Phase 6: CI Check (post-merge)

Run `gh run list --branch main --limit 3` and watch the post-merge run.

- If CI passes: done. Report the merged PR URL and final status.
- If CI fails: report the failure with logs. Do not attempt auto-fix on main — flag it for the user.

## Notes

- `` can provide a branch name, PR title hint, or both.
- Never force-push, never skip hooks, never push directly to main/master.
- If at any point the user needs to take a manual action, stop and clearly state what is needed.
